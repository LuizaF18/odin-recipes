    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 heaping teaspoon <strong>turmeric</strong></li>
        <li>2 tablespoons <strong>olive oil</strong></li>
        <li>1 large <strong>yellow onion</strong>, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>2 <strong>bell peppers</strong> (red, orange or yellow), cored and thinly sliced</li>
        <li>4 cloves <strong>garlic</strong>, minced</li>
        <li>150g <strong>green beans</strong>, cut into 2-inch pieces</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons <strong>tomato paste</strong></li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoon <strong>smoked paprika</strong></li>
        <li>2-3 <strong>bay leaves</strong></li>
        <li>300g <strong>short grain rice</strong> (Valencia or arborio)</li>
        <li>~800ml <strong>low-sodium vegetable broth</strong></li>
        <li>1 jar (~300gr) <strong>artichoke hearts</strong> in water, drained and quartered</li>
        <li>150g <strong>green peas</strong> (fresh or frozen, thawed)</li>
        <li>chopped <strong>parsley</strong> leaves, to garnish</li>
        <li><strong>salt</strong> to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Saute:</strong> Heat olive oil/broth over medium heat in a large wide flat-bottomed pan or paella pan (a dutch oven or large pot would also suffice). Add onions and bell peppers, cook until tender, about 5 minutes. Add garlic, green beans, tomatoes, smoked paprika, red pepper flakes and bay leaves, cook another 3 minutes stirring frequently. For softer veggies, cook another 7 minutes or so, totaling 10 minutes after adding the latter ingredients.</li>
        <li><strong>Add rice and broth:</strong> Add in the rice, broth, saffron mixture/turmeric and salt. Gently move the vegetables around so the rice falls to the bottom of the pan as much as possible.</li>
        <li><strong>Boil and simmer:</strong> Bring to a boil, reduce heat to medium or medium-low and cook at a continuous gentle boil, uncovered, for 15 minutes. Do not stir the rice. If using a large paella pan (15 inches or so) you’ll want to rotate the pan over the burner every so often to help cook the rice evenly. Stay in the kitchen and clean up so you’re right there to adjust the pan when needed. If liquids seem to boil off too quickly, add a little extra warm water/broth.</li>
        <li><strong>Add peas and artichokes:</strong> After 15 minutes of cooking, scatter the peas and artichoke hearts on top, cook for 5 minutes more.</li>
        <li><strong>Cover to steam:</strong> Turn off heat and cover for 10 minutes with a kitchen towel or other cover of choice. This will allow the rice to absorb any remaining liquid as well as steam the peas and warm the artichoke hearts and any other optional ingredients added as noted below. Once done, lightly fluff the rice and serve. Discard bay leaves before eating. Season with salt, pepper or more paprika to taste.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>This recipe serves 4-6. Leftovers can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 5-6 days, in a covered container.</p>
